				The best way to prevent e-waste build-up is to simply buy less of it. Not only do you
				reduce the amount of e-waste, but by purchasing less electronics, you reduce your carbon
				footprint. This means less pollution to the environment, in more ways than one.

			<p class="no-indent">
				Instead of throwing your electronics away, consider putting it to a different use. Perhaps
				your desktop can be repurposed into a server, or maybe your television can double as a computer
				monitor. If it ain't broke, don't throw it away!

				There are countless nonprofits that are more than willing to take your "waste!" One such
				nonprofit is <a href="http://www.rebootforyouth.org" target="_blank">Reboot for Youth</a>,
				a 501(c)3 organization founded by TJ students dedicated to e-cycling. Reboot for Youth empowers
				children in need with the computers you donate!

					e-cycling program</a>, and you can e-cycle any household electronics for free. They are
				all week long, and are the perfect solution for residents in the County.

			<h1>And if there's no other way...</h1>
			<p class="no-indent">
				Last but not least, recycling your old electronics can still be beneficial to the environment.
				Although recycling evidently pollutes the environment, it remains better than sending your
				electronics off to a landfill. When you recycle electronics, they do not get melted down
				into liquid metals as you might expect. Instead, they get stripped of their reusable
				components.
