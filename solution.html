				The best way to prevent e-waste build-up is to simply buy less of it. Not only do you
				reduce the amount of e-waste, but by purchasing less electronics, you reduce your carbon
				footprint. This means less pollution to the environment, in more ways than one.

				Last but not least, recycling your old electronics can still be beneficial to the environment.
				Although recycling evidently pollutes the environment, it remains better than sending your
				electronics off to a landfill. When you recycle electronics, they do not get melted down
				into liquid metals as you might expect. Instead, they get stripped of their reusable
				components.
